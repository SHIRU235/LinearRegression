Name: Shiranth Stephen Sahaya Anbu Anitha
Student Id: 8961999

## Project Description
This lab trains and evaluates three univariate linear regression models to predict median house values in California based on:

- Median Income
- Population
- Number of Households

The goal is to explore which variable best predicts housing prices, using visualization, error metrics (MSE and MAE), and insights directed at non-ML experts (e.g., product managers).

## Tools Used
- Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn (LinearRegression, MSE, MAE)
